# Overview

Curandera is a python library that heals you from CMake's bullshit. It provides
an API for extracting info on a given CMake project, while also permitting the
ability to configure, generate, and build a project all in one command, or as
a series of commands.

## Why the name?

Curandera is traditionally a medicine woman. Using mysticism they heal the sick,
while also providing comfort. They are closely related to Bruja's in that they
are practicing witchcraft, however theirs is used for healing.

Curandera is part of the Occult C++ Initiaive, a set of tools and libraries
meant to *demystify* the black magic of C and C++ toolchains, compilers, build
systems, and package managers. Curandera is a key component for extracting
build information, and is a dependency of [brujeria]
