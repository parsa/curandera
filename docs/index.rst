Overview
========

Curandera is a python library to help extract information from a CMake project.
In addition to this, it is also able to configure, generate, and build a CMake
project. It is able to do this asynchronously, and as a result can be run on
several projects at once. This can speed up projects that build several CMake
projects at once.
